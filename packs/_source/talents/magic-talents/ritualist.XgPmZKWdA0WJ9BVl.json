      "value": "<p>Your study of magic has unlocked the mysteries of ritual spells. When you gain this talent, you also gain a ritual book, which contains the rituals you know. To cast a ritual spell, you must have your ritual book in hand.</p><p>Choose a circle of magic: arcane or divine. You must choose your rituals from that circleâ€™s ritual list. Regardless of which circle you choose, you use your normal spellcasting ability for these spells.</p><p>When you gain your ritual book, add one ritual of each spell ring you have already unlocked via your spellcasting class. For example, a cleric who selects this talent at 4th level has spell slots for the 1st ring and 2nd ring, so they would add one 1st-ring ritual and one 2nd-ring ritual to their book.</p><p>Each time you gain access to a new ring of spell slots by gaining a level in your spellcasting class, add one new ritual spell to your book. This new ritual must be from the same circle of magic you originally chose, and it must be of a ring for which you have spell slots. For example, when a cleric reaches 5th level, they gain access to 3rd-ring spells, so the cleric would select one ritual spell of 3rd ring or lower to add to their ritual book.</p>",
