Such overabundance of power might come from a mystic connection to the primal fey realms or a distant echo of a primordial spell cast long ago.</p><p>This power transforms the fauna that dwell there, giving rise to wise beasts with gifts of speech and reason. They develop nature-based societies unlike those found in humanoid civilizations.</p><p>Members of these communities are raised in territories unspoiled by the trappings of civilization, where beasts and humanoids live alongside one another as equals. A wildlands community is typically composed of intelligent beasts and humanoids with beast traits—like the beastkin—who work together to defend the interests of all who share their characteristics.</p><p>Indeed, preservation of these interests is one of the few reasons members of this heritage ever leave their territories. Whenever encroaching civilization puts a wildlands community at risk, the task of gathering information or forging diplomatic relations falls upon the more humanoid-like members of such groups.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.black-flag.heritages.Item.60G46JAl2vtIp8PU inline]{Beast Affinity}</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.black-flag.heritages.Item.nPYmLXHoB7uhALKV inline]{Shepherd's Gift}</p><p>@Embed[.Advancement.6XFMqppJfCZOIRbe inline]{Languages}</p>"
