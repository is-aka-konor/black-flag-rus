Long ago, groups of dwarves following this tradition settled near areas of volcanic activity, turning such places into their forges. These dwarves were the founders of the fireforge clans. To this day, these communities toil in the heat of magma, creating weapons, armor, and goods noteworthy even among the finest dwarven crafts. They trade these goods for necessities not found in the harsh environment of their chosen settlements.</p><p>Fireforge communities maintain good relations with elemental creatures, coming to their aid when needed. In return, these elementals assist fireforge clans against giants, dragons, and other volcano-dwelling creatures who often compete for territory.</p><p>@Embed[.Advancement.VpPCqlaEhJzLWlve inline]{Expert Artisan}</p><p>@Embed[.Advancement.u3qKVwzO5MtE5Rju inline]{Forgecraft}</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.black-flag.heritages.Item.DUGqj8nRddAySbxl inline]{Friend to Elementals}</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.black-flag.heritages.Item.7glPCTjcm6iffryd inline]{Reforge}</p><p>@Embed[.Advancement.LaRbvQ8c1RgUPIkZ inline]{Languages}</p>"
