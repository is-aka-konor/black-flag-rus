How the early beastkin survived and prospered alongside such vicious predators remains unclear, but the descendants of these beastkin, referred to as slayers, have an expert understanding of hunting, tracking, and harvesting from their environment.</p><p>Slayer communities dedicate their lives to hunting other powerful predators that might topple natural ecosystems, such as dragons or trolls. Sometimes slayer packs accept coin to kill specific monsters, but more often, they purchase goods they canâ€™t make with treasures seized from monster lairs or profits made from selling harvested monster parts.</p><p>Given their dangerous lifestyle, slayer communities value strength and tracking skill. Slayers who can no longer hunt due to age, illness, or injury are honorably retired from the pack to live with non-slayer relatives. However, rumor also tells of hidden villages populated by retired slayers.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.black-flag.heritages.Item.6J1NfgxVkXX2RIfE inline]{Ferocity}</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.black-flag.heritages.Item.SqSal1OIRyeCBN4e inline]{Tracker}</p><p>@Embed[.Advancement.keARfPlTLtOG9ree inline]{Languages}</p>"
