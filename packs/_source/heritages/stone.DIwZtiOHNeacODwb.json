From infancy, people of the stone are instructed in the dwarven arts of smithing, metalworking, and masonry. Many devote their lives to mining and working precious metals beneath the surface of the world.</p><p>Though members of the stone dwarf clans take pride in their society, life in their cities is far from easy. The splendid caverns and mines occupied by the stone dwarves are under constant attack by other subterranean denizens.</p><p>As children are raised to swing a mining pick, they are also taught to swing arms against the enemies that seek generations of dwarven treasures for themselves.</p><p>@Embed[.Advancement.UfgIbyYeyB2gmOKF inline]{Dwarven Weapon Training}</p><p>@Embed[.Advancement.oEho4hQyBhZJMLFx inline]{Tool Proficiency}</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.black-flag.heritages.Item.XOetZrMvNqZpHNqk inline]{Eye for Quality}</p><p>@Embed[.Advancement.xXPTXP1d51PbAzyc inline]{Languages}</p>"
