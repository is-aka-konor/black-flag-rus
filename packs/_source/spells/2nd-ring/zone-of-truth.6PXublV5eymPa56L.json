Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a CHA save. On a failed save, a creature can’t speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on its save.</p><p>An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth.</p>",
