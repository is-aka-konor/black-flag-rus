      "value": "<p><em>You conjure a roiling ball of flame that acts on your command.</em></p><p>A 5-foot-diameter sphere of fire appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within range and lasts for the duration. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the sphere must make a DEX save. The creature takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><p>As a bonus action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet. If you ram the sphere into a creature, that creature must make the save against the sphereâ€™s damage, and the sphere stops moving this turn.</p><p>When you move the sphere, you can direct it over barriers up to 5 feet tall and jump it across pits up to 10 feet wide. The sphere ignites flammable objects not being worn or carried, and it sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.</p>",
