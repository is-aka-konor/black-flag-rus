On a hit, you afflict the creature with a disease of your choice selected from the options below.</p><p>At the end of each of the target’s turns, it must make a CON save. After failing three of these saves, the disease’s effects last for the duration, and the creature stops making these saves. After succeeding on three of these saves, the creature recovers from the disease and the spell ends.</p><p>Since this spell induces a natural disease in its target, any effect that removes or suppresses a disease’s effects apply to it.</p><p><strong>Blinding Sickness.</strong> Pain grips the creature’s mind, and its eyes turn milky white. The creature has disadvantage on WIS checks and WIS saves and is blinded.</p><p><strong>Filth Fever.</strong> A raging fever sweeps through the creature’s body. The creature has disadvantage on STR checks, STR saves, and attack rolls that use STR.</p><p><strong>Flesh Rot.</strong> The creature’s flesh decays. The creature has disadvantage on CHA checks and becomes vulnerable to all damage.</p><p><strong>Mindfire.</strong> The creature’s mind becomes feverish. The creature has disadvantage on INT checks and INT saves, and the creature behaves as if under the effects of the confusion spell during combat.</p><p><strong>Seizure.</strong> The creature is overcome with shaking.
