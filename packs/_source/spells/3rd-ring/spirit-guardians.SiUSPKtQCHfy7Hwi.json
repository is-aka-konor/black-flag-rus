They flit around you to a distance of 15 feet for the duration.</p><p>When you cast this spell, you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it. An affected creatureâ€™s speed is halved in the area, and when the creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a WIS save. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 radiant damage or 3d8 necrotic damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.</p>",
