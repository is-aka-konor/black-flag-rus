Choose a door, a window, or an area within range that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. Until the spell ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a Tiny or larger creature touches or enters the warded area. When you cast the spell, you can designate creatures that wonâ€™t set off the alarm. You also choose whether the alarm is mental or audible.</p><p>A mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping.</p><p>An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell for 10 seconds within 60 feet.</p><p>If you perform this ritual a second time before the duration of the first alarm spell has ended, the first alarm immediately ends.</p>",
