      "value": "<p>A crucial step on the path of the spell blade is learning to synergize weapons with your magical power. If you spend one hour of uninterrupted focus in contact with a weapon—which can be done during a rest—you can imbue that weapon with a limited form of enchantment. This enchantment lasts until you choose to end it, or you use this feature to enchant a different weapon.</p><p>Your enchanted weapon functions as a magic weapon with the following properties:</p><ul><li><p>You have +1 to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it. If the weapon would normally grant a magical bonus to attack and damage, your enchantment bonus stacks with the weapon’s existing bonus.</p></li><li><p>You can use a bonus action to summon the weapon if it is on the same plane of existence as you. When you do so, the weapon instantly appears in your hand.</p></li></ul><p>Creatures who handle or inspect the enchanted weapon can tell it isn’t a true magic item—unless the weapon was magic to begin with—otherwise, it follows the rules of a typical magic item (see Magic Items in Chapter 3).</p>",
