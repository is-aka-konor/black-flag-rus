You also gain a number of sorcery points equal to the spell’s circle.</p><p>Alternatively, you can target a magical effect within 30 feet of you that was created by a spell, such as <em>fog cloud</em> or <em>wall of fire</em>. On a successful CHA check, the spell ends.</p><p>Once you successfully devour a spell, you can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest, unless you spend 4 sorcery points to do so.</p>",
