Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of creatures with spellcasting ability, ongoing spell effects, or magic items within 30 feet of you. If the magical effect is the result of an ongoing spell, you learn which school of magic the spell belongs to.</p><p>Magic sense can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.</p><p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your PB + 1. When you finish a long rest, you regain all uses.</p>",
