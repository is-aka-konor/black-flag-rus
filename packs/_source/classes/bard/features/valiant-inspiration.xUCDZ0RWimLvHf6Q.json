The extra damage is of the same type as that of the triggering attack (though the attacker chooses which type if there are more than one). Alternatively, when a creature with one of your Bardic Inspiration dice takes damage, the creature can use its reaction to expend and roll the die to reduce the amount of damage taken by an amount equal to the number rolled + your CHA modifier.</p>",
