Only another creature who knows Thieves’ Cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.</p><p>In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.</p>",
