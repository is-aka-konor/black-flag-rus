It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven’t cast a spell of the 1st ring or higher since your last turn. You can also choose to dismiss your ward at any time (no action required by you).</p><p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your PB, and you regain all uses of it when you finish a long rest.</p>",
